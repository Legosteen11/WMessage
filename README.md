# WMessage

WMessage is a small, easy-to-use php script to add a comment system to your site! It uses MySQL for its database and it has been protected against bots with the use of Google ReCaptcha.
### Setup
How to set WMessage up:
1. Download the WMessage file.

2. Edit the WMessage file and replace: ``` KEY ``` with your [ReCaptcha] secret key. ``` HOST ``` With your MySQL host. ``` USER ``` With your MySQL username. ``` PASSWORD ``` With your MySQL password. And ``` DATABASE ``` With the database you want WMessage to make a table in.

3. Upload the file to your webserver. And go to the url where you uploaded it. WMessage will create it's own table now.
